## Description

Puppercoin.sol is resposnsible for creating a new ERC20 token called puppercoin. Most of the code is inhareted from OpenZeppelin

The CrowdSale.sol contract manages the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin). This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

You will likely need to develop a front end user interface to work with the back end smar contracts.
